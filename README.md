# Statistical-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning-to-study-the-impact-of-exercise-in-diabetic-patients

This work aims to analyze the impact of physical activity in the blood glucose level distribution of diabetic patients by comparing it against the distribution in normal 
daily activity scenarios. This is done through the use of statistical inference techniques (parametric and non-parametric) and clinical methodologies (eg: analysis of the 
Clarke Error Grid).

Moreover, artificial intelligence methods are used to identify whether patients have done exercise or not using only their blood glucose measurements. Feature extraction 
and selection are done prior to training the models. Model interpretability is also provided.
